# Credit_default_prediction

This project is used to detect the next month defaulters of credit card payments beforehand inorder to make appropriate decisions.
The defaulters are determined based on their background details, their previous 6 month generated bills (amount + interest) by the bank,
amount paid by the person each month to settle the total amount, whether there are any delay in payments each month (pay status) and other parameters.

This dataset is imbalanced, therefore various undersampling and oversampling techniques are implemented to balance the dataset.
